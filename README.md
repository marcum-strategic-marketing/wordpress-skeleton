A WordPress Skeleton Website And Template Repository

This is meant to be a starting point for a new WordPress website build project.
Ideally this repository will be kept up to date with the latest needs from a starting point site.
A new project would be started from this template repository and modified as needed from there.

Upon cloning wp-config.php will need modified with the agreed upon URLs including the local dev URL as well as the DB info for dev, staging, and production.

The respective DB will need to be setup and imported from the (db) folder.

Included Advanced Custom Fields, Custom Post Type UI, Yoast SEO, and ACF Content Analysis for Yoast SEO Plugins.

This Repo also includes branches if you wish to start with a front-end framework.
Understrap branch includes the Understrap and Understrap-Child themes with preconfiguration for using Understrap-Child.

**Don't Forget To Change The DB And WordPress Login For Production**
